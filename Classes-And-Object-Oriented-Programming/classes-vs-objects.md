# Classes vs. Objects
It is important to remember that classes are just templates for creating new objects. Objects contain both a state and behavior, and is an instance of a class.


### Instances
An **instance** is a specific version of an object that can differ in numerous ways.

Going back to the previous chapter, ***Rectangle***, ***Animal***, and ***Vehicle*** are all classes. These classes, as is, are considered a type, unless you create a specific version of the class. 

So, in this case, if we create two different vehicles they would be specific instances of the ***Vehicle*** class.
