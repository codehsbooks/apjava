# Introduction to Classes and Objects

Classes and Objects are utilized in Java as part of the Object Oriented Programming model. This model focuses on objects and the data and actions associated with the objects.

## Object

Objects are structures that contain a state and behavior. 

##### State
The state contains the information about the specific object.

##### Behavior
The behavior is the actions that can be performed on the specific object.

## Classes
Classes are the templates we use for creating objects.

##### Rectangle Class

##### Animal Class

##### Vehicle Class

## Creating Objects

When creating a new object from a class you will use this format:

``` Java 
[Class Name] [Object Name] = new [Class Name] (params);

// Here are some examples using the classes we created earlier

Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(20, 8);

Animal pet = new Animal("Dog", "Cujo", 2);

Vehicle myTruck = new Vehicle("Truck", 20, 173600);
```
