# Polymorphism
<hr>
***Polymorphism*** is one of the most important concepts in Object Oriented Programming.
<br>
<br>
***Polymorphism*** is the capability of a single object to take on multiple forms. ***Polymorphism*** can also be explained as the ability to perform a single action in many ways across multiple objects. It also allows us to use the same method across different objects, using different implementations. 

### Polymorphism Concepts
<hr>
There are several concepts of ***polymorphism*** that are crucial to remember. These include:

- **Upcasting: **

- **Dynamic Binding: **

- **Static Binding: **

- **Method Overriding: **

### Upcasting:
<hr>

### Dynamic Binding
<hr>
Dynamic Binding is the concept where the proper method implementation is chosen at run-time, and not compile-time.

### Static Binding
<hr>

### Method Overriding
<hr>
Method overriding allows us to call the correct implementation of a method across multiple objects that share the same superclass.
